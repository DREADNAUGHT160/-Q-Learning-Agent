üê≠ Mouse Escape: Q-Learning Agent Navigating a Grid Environment
This project showcases a Q-learning-based AI agent that navigates through an 8x8 grid-based environment to reach its goal (the "female mouse"), while avoiding obstacles like walls, "hell states," and teleportation tunnels. The AI is trained using reinforcement learning with an epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation. It aims to maximize rewards and find the optimal path.

Key features:

Grid-based navigation with dynamic obstacles and teleportation tunnels.
Q-learning algorithm implementation with reward-based feedback.
Custom environment design including walls, "hell states" (negative rewards), and teleportation mechanics.
